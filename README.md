 Abstract 
Aims:  We sought to explore the response of the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration and QT 
dispersion (QTD) to hemodialysis.  Methods:  We enrolled 50 patients with end-stage renal dis
ease undergoing regular hemodialysis. Blood samples were drawn for measurement of serum 
electrolytes, and a 12-lead ECG was performed to measure the QTc interval duration and QTD, 
immediately before and just after dialysis sessions.  Results:  The mean age of the cohort was 
42.8  8  12.2 years (58% males). Both the QTc duration and QTD showed marked variability after 
hemodialysis. A significant correlation was found between the decrease of both serum potas
sium and magnesium levels after dialysis and the post-dialysis QTc interval duration, with Pear
son’s correlation coefficients r = –0.43 and r = –0.34, p = 0.002 and p = 0.01, respectively. Patients 
with a post-dialysis increase of QTc interval duration had a significantly higher percentage of 
reduction of serum potassium (p = 0.029), whereas patients with a post-dialysis increase of QTD 
had a significantly higher percentage of reduction of serum magnesium (p = 0.03).  Conclusion:
 Our findings suggest a highly variable response of the QTc interval duration and QTD to hemo
dialysis. The post-dialysis QTc interval duration inversely correlated with the decrease of both 
serum potassium and magnesium levels after dialysis.

 Despite the recent advances in hemodialysis technology, mortality is still high among 
dialysis patients. Cardiovascular mortality is estimated to be 10-fold that of the general pop
ulation, and it usually occurs suddenly  [1–3] . The mechanism responsible for the augmented 
risk of sudden death in dialysis patients remains unclear; yet, 24-hour Holter monitoring 
unveiled a high prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias during and immediately following 
dialysis  [1, 4] .
 There is considerable evidence that the QT interval is closely related to ventricular action 
potential and is a good non-invasive measure of the repolarization process. Several reports 
indicate that regional differences in static QT interval measurement (QT dispersion) from 
12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG) may provide an indirect measure of the underlying 
non-homogeneity of ventricular repolarization  [5] . QT dispersion (QTD) is defined as the 
difference between the longest and the shortest QT intervals on surface ECG  [6] . An increase 
in QTD is reported to predict the occurrence of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhyth
mias and sudden cardiac death in patients with ischemic heart disease  [7] . 
In dialysis patients, both prolongation of the QT interval  [8–10]  and increase of the QTD 
[11–13]  have been reported during hemodialysis sessions. These alterations of ventricular 
repolarization might provide a potential substrate for lethal ventricular arrhythmias in this 
fragile patient category. It is well known, as well, that both hypokalemia and hypomagnese
mia can increase the action potential duration and prolong the QT interval. In a cross-sec
tional study design, we sought to explore the response of the corrected QT (QTc) interval 
duration and QTD to hemodialysis and evaluate the effect of serum electrolyte changes dur
ing hemodialysis on these parameters in patients with end-stage renal disease.
  Materials and Methods 
Patient Selection and Study Design 
We included 50 clinically stable patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing 
chronic regular hemodialysis in our dialysis unit; patients were enrolled during March and 
April 2010. The causes of end-stage renal disease included chronic glomerulonephritis in 13 
(26%) patients, hypertensive nephrosclerosis in 9 (18%), obstructive uropathy in 5 (10%), and 
idiopathic in 6 (12%); 17 (34%) patients had other causes. All patients were dry-weight stable 
for at least 3 months and had achieved a normotensive edema-free state. All patients were 
given intravenous erythropoietin 3 times a week (mean dosage 23  8  7 IU/kg). We excluded 
patients with known ischemic heart disease, previously diagnosed congenital long QT syn
drome, atrial fibrillation, paced rhythm or bundle branch block, known organic heart dis
ease (valvular or hypertensive heart disease, or cardiomyopathy), advanced liver disease, 
and patients receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval (for example quini
dine and amiodarone). Before inclusion, an informed written consent was obtained from 
each patient after full explanation of the study protocol, and the study protocol was re
viewed and approved by our local Institutional Human Research Committee which con
forms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2002.
  Doppler Echocardiography 
Doppler echocardiography was performed using a General Electric Vivid 7 Pro cardiac 
ultrasound machine (General Electric, Horten, Norway). A 2.5-MHz phased array probe was 
used to obtain standard 2-D, M-mode and Doppler images. Patients were examined in the 
left lateral recumbent position using standard parasternal and apical views. Left ventricular

 dimensions were evaluated from 2-D-derived M-mode measurements. Biplane left ventricu
lar ejection fraction was estimated from the 2- and 4-chamber views using the modified 
Simpson’s method. Assessment of valve morphology and function as well as regional wall 
motion abnormalities were performed in the standard way.
  Dialysis Regimen 
Dialysis was performed for 3.5–4 h per session, with blood flow 300 ml/min, dialysis 
membrane AN69, and mean weight loss set at 2.5 kg. All patients were treated with a dialysis 
regimen of bicarbonate dialysis set at the following electrolyte composition in the bath: Na 
138 mEq/l, K 2 mEq/l, Ca 3 mEq/l, Mg 1 mEq/l, Cl 111 mEq/l, acetate 3 mEq/l, and bicar
bonate 33 mEq/l. During hemodialysis, no drug therapy was allowed, except isotonic saline 
infusion and sodium heparin. All dialysis sessions were conducted using an Integra machine 
(Hospal, Bologna, Italy).
  L a b o r a t o r y A n a l y s i s 
A 5-ml venous blood sample was drawn by phlebotomy immediately before and just af
ter dialysis sessions, collected in a sterile tube, immediately put on ice, centrifuged on site 
within 90 min, and frozen on dry ice. Blood samples were shipped within 24 h to our central 
laboratory, where they were stored at –80  
 °  
 C until analyzed. Samples were assessed for serum 
sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium ions. All laboratory analyses were performed 
using routine automated methods.
  E l e c t r o c a r d i o g r a p h i c A s s e s s m e n t 
All enrolled patients underwent a resting high-quality 12-lead ECG recording, which 
was subsequently evaluated by an expert electrophysiologist blinded to both clinical and lab 
data. QT interval was measured using the manual technique, as the time in milliseconds be
tween the first deflection of the QRS complex and the point of return of the T wave to the 
isoelectric line. Measurements were obtained in 3 consecutive complexes in each lead, and 
the mean value was used. The leads in which the end of the T wave could not be clearly iden
tified were excluded from analysis  [14] . In leads with a U wave, the nadir between the T and 
U waves was considered as the end of the T wave. We recorded the maximal and minimal 
QT intervals, and calculated the QTD as the difference between the two intervals, which was 
individually recorded for each patient  [15] . We then calculated the QTc interval from the Ba
zett’s formula as follows: QTc interval = QT interval/  RR  [16] . Finally, the QTc dispersion 
(QTcD) was calculated as the difference between the maximal and minimal QTc intervals. 
These measurements were estimated 10 min before and 10 min following the dialysis session. 
The mean values of QT and QTc intervals as well as QTD and QTcD were calculated for the 
study group, separately, before and after dialysis. 
  Statistical Analysis 
All continuous variables were presented as means  8  SD if they were normally distrib
uted. Data were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Categor
ical variables were described with absolute and relative (percentage) frequencies. Paired t test 
was used to compare QT intervals, QTD values, and serum electrolytes before and after di
alysis within the study group. Pearson’s correlation coefficient test was performed to study 
the correlation between the QT intervals and QTD values, on the one hand, and the change 
of serum electrolytes following dialysis, on the other hand. All tests were two-sided, and a 
probability value of p  !  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were per
formed with SPSS version 12.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA).

  R e s u l t s 
A total of 50 patients with end-stage renal disease on regular hemodialysis were enrolled 
in the current study. The mean age of the study group was 42.8  8  12.2 years, 29 (58%) pa
tients being males. Patients were undergoing hemodialysis 3 times a week (3.5–4 h per ses
sion); the mean duration of being dependent on dialysis was 6.4  8  2.7 years (range 2–10 
years). Six (12%) patients were diabetic and 33 (66%) were hypertensive. The mean systolic 
blood pressure was 131  8  28 mm Hg, whereas the mean diastolic blood pressure was 81  8
 16 mm Hg. Diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures, body weight, and total ultrafiltra
tion were in line with our dialysis prescription in all sessions. The mean values of serum 
electrolytes before and after dialysis are shown in  table 1 . The mean QT interval duration 
and QTD values, before and after dialysis, are shown in  table 2 . 
Both the QTc interval duration and QTD showed marked variability after hemodialysis. 
Following hemodialysis sessions, the QTc interval duration increased in 23 (46%) patients 
and decreased in 27 (54%); QTD increased in 20 (40%) patients, decreased in 21 (42%), and 
remained almost unchanged in the rest. A QTc interval duration of  1 440 ms was found in 
45 (90%) patients before dialysis, whereas after dialysis, it was found in 47 (94%) patients. A 
QTD of  1 65 ms was found in 10 (20%) patients before dialysis, whereas after dialysis, it was 
found in 17 (34%) patients.
 A significant correlation was found between the decrease of both serum potassium and 
magnesium levels after dialysis and the post-dialysis QTc interval duration, with Pearson’s 
correlation coefficients r = –0.43 and r = –0.34, p = 0.002 and p = 0.01, respectively ( fig. 1 ,  2 ). 
However, no significant correlation was found between the decrease of either serum sodium 
or calcium after dialysis and the post-dialysis QTc interval duration (p  1  0.05 for both). Sim
ilarly, no significant correlation was found between the decrease of any of the serum electro
lytes after dialysis and the post-dialysis QTD (p  1  0.05 for all).

  Discussion 
 Major Findings 
The current study demonstrated a marked variability of both the QTc interval duration 
and QTD in response to hemodialysis. Additionally, the post-dialysis QTc interval duration 
significantly correlated with the decrease of both serum potassium and magnesium levels 
after dialysis. Moreover, the percentage of reduction of serum potassium was significantly 
higher in patients with a post-dialysis increase of QTc interval duration as compared to those 
with a post-dialysis decrease of this value. Similarly, the percentage of reduction of serum 
magnesium was significantly higher in patients with a post-dialysis increase of QTD as com
pared to those with no post-dialysis increase of this value.
 Response of the QTc Interval Duration 
Accumulating evidence has been controversial concerning the impact of hemodialysis 
on the ECG surrogates of ventricular repolarization in patients with end-stage renal disease. 
Whereas it has long been believed that a dialysis-induced prolongation of the QTc interval 
duration – and increase of the QTD – was responsible for lethal ventricular arrhythmias 
during and immediately following hemodialysis, some emerging evidence suggests a de
crease – rather than increase – of the QT and/or QTc interval after dialysis  [17–19] . Patients 
with end-stage renal disease are a heterogeneous population in which a complex interplay of 
many factors determines the response of the QTc interval to hemodialysis. Furthermore, the 
regimen employed in hemodialysis may also play a role in depicting the ‘final scene’ of ven
tricular repolarization. In this regard, one comparative study reported that bicarbonate di

 alysis reduces the QT and QTc intervals duration more than acetate-free biofiltration  [17] . 
Since nitric oxide is produced more with the former dialysis regimen as compared with the 
latter  [20] , the authors suggested a possible role of nitric oxide in shortening the post-dialysis 
QT and QTc intervals duration in that study. Nitric oxide excess can depress cardiomyocytes 
and inhibit vascular smooth muscle cells; these effects were more profound with bicarbonate 
dialysis  [17] . The inverse correlation between nitric oxide and QT interval duration was fur
ther demonstrated in the literature  [21] . In addition, the electrical remodeling effect of ure
mic cardiomyopathy and the alterations of ion influx/efflux between the intra- and extracel
lular compartments might further complicate the picture  [22, 23] . Moreover, changes in the 
rennin-angiotensin system may be implicated in the heterogeneity of the QT interval  [24] . 
Ultimately, an interesting study suggested that polymorphism of angiotensin-converting en
zyme and angiotensin type-1 receptor genes might contribute to the prolonged QTc interval 
in hemodialysis patients  [25] .
 Effect of Electrolyte Changes 
Another point of debate was the correlation between serum electrolytes – in particular 
serum potassium and magnesium levels – and the occurrence of QT interval prolongation 
and increase of QTD after dialysis. In this respect, our findings substantiated evidence from 
many earlier reports, which demonstrated that the increase of QT interval duration and 
QTD inversely correlated with serum potassium and/or magnesium levels  [8, 26] . Neverthe
less, other evidence from some peer-reviewed literature did not support such a correlation 
[27, 28] . Again, the composition of the dialysis bath may eventually play a pivotal role in this 
regard. Genovesi et al.  [29]  compared the effect of 6 dialysis baths with different ion compo
sition on the QTc interval duration after sessions. Not surprisingly, they found that the lon
gest QTc interval duration occurred with the low-potassium/low-calcium dialysate, whereas 
the shortest occurred with the high-potassium/high-calcium dialysate. Interestingly, they 
reported an inverse correlation between the QT interval changes and serum potassium and 
calcium levels, but not with serum magnesium  [29] . As a matter of fact, their results would 
favor a high-potassium/high-calcium dialysis regimen, at least from the safety point of view. 
Nevertheless, a high-calcium dialysate might predispose to hypercalcemia and vascular cal
cification, and a high-potassium dialysate might not adequately remove potassium load from 
the plasma. In another intriguing study, Buemi et al.  [30]  compared hemodiafiltration with 
a constant potassium concentration and hemodiafiltration with a variable potassium con
centration set at 1 mEq/l less than that in plasma, which gradually decreased throughout the 
session, maintaining an almost constant plasma-dialysate potassium concentration gradi
ent. Interestingly, they found that post-dialysis QTD was significantly lower in the variable 
as compared to the constant regimen  [30] . Indeed, the variable regimen sustained a constant 
potassium gradient that effectively achieved a gradual removal of potassium, in contrast to 
the rapid drop of plasma potassium with the constant regimen, at least early during sessions. 
Moreover, they found that hyperpolarization of the red cell membrane occurred with the 
constant but not with the variable regimen, something that could have a destabilizing effect 
on different types of cardiac cells, inviting reentrant circuits  [30] .
  Clinical Implications 
In view of the highly variable response of the QTc interval duration and QTD to hemo
dialysis sessions, we believe that the dialysis regimen must be customized in a way that se
cures the maximal safety for each patient. ECG recording for patients on hemodialysis fol
lowing each dialysis session would effectively identify patients whose repolarization surro
gates increase after sessions. In these patients, we can individually adopt a dialysis regimen 
which is, reportedly, less likely to affect ventricular repolarization. Assessment of the QT in

terval measures would offer a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and widely available tool to gauge 
early changes in ventricular repolarization. In our quest to raise the standard of care for 
many patients with end-stage renal disease, we would recommend routine measurement of 
the QTc interval duration and QTD from ECG recorded in the immediate post-dialysis pe
riod. Additionally, serum potassium and magnesium levels should be regularly checked and 
immediately corrected following each dialysis session.
  Conclusion 
 Our findings suggest a highly variable response of the QTc interval duration and QTD 
to hemodialysis sessions. The post-dialysis QTc interval duration inversely correlated with 
the change of both serum potassium and magnesium levels after dialysis.
  Limitations of the Study 
 Our findings are based on a single center study with a relatively small sample size of the 
cohort, a fact that makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. Multicenter studies using 
the same protocol and examining a larger number of patients are needed for more solid con
clusions to be drawn. Besides, measurement of the QT interval should rather be performed 
automatically, by means of computer software. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the de
sign which does not infer any causal or temporal relationship necessitates careful interpreta
tion of the results.
